problem statement
- Group performance data for each platform by date (day granularity)
- The columns will include standard SUM and AVG aggregations, such as clicks and cost.
- Additional calculated columns for each day, including the previous day and 7 days ago
- Grouping by metrics based on date and campaign naming convention (using regex). For
example, for campaigns named "Campaign [RT]" vs. "Campaign [PROS]" we will want RT cost
vs. PROS cost.
- The campaign naming logic should be case-insensitive and account for if itâ€™s in the front of the
name vs back.. Eg. "[rt] Campaign"

Expected output
The deliverable will be SQL queries that produce the desired results. And create the
columns as described below.
The queries should have a clear naming convention and either comments to explain
what's going on or a brief screenshare/loom.com walkthrough.
Bonus: Visualize output in a dashboarding platform (PowerBI / DataStudio / Tableau /
Jupyter)
Bonus: For any visualization platform you use, try to use the platform's best practices.
(DAX in case of power bi etc)
